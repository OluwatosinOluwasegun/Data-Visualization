### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a store who deals in sport bike, clothing(jersey), other related accessories over a certain period of 2011-2016. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations and, gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.
### Data Sources

Sales Data: the primary data used for this analyis is the "BikeSales_data.csv file", containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel- data cleaning
- Powerpoint- data presentation

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
   EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
   What is the overall sales trend?
   What are the top tier sales by Rep?
   What are the results of their sales by region?
   What are the top tier products by revenue?
   What are the most purchased colour by units?
   

### Results and Findings
The company sales have been increasing continously over the past years but there was a slope between 2016-2017, bringing down the revenue accrued over the years.
Product category "Quad" is the best performing category in form of sales and revenue.
Economy conditions of other Countries should be considered before placing prices on products.

### Recommendations:
Based on the analysis we recommend the following actions:
- Adapt your products or services to suit the preferences and needs of the target market.
-  Offer country-specific promotions, discounts, or incentives to attract customers.
-   Monitor sales performance, customer feedback, and market trends regularly.

  ### Limitations:
  I had to format the revenue, cost, profit to currency, hide blanks because they will affect the accuarcy of my conclusions from the analytics.
