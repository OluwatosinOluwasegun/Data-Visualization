### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

   ### Exploratory Data Analyis
   EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
   What is the overall sales trend?
   Which products are top sellers?
   What are the top 10 states by order of quantity?
   What are the top 10 most profitable products?
   What are the top 5 costly products?
   What are the sales by Gender?
   What are the top 5 best selling products?


### Results/Findings
The company sales have been increasing continously over the past years but there was a slope between 2015-2016, bringing down the revenue accrued over the years.
Product category "road bikes" is the best performing category in form of sales and revenue.
Economy conditions of other Countries should be considered before placing prices on products.

### Recommendations:
Based on the analysis we recommend the following actions:
- Adapt your products or services to suit the preferences and needs of the target market.
-  Offer country-specific promotions, discounts, or incentives to attract customers.
-   Monitor sales performance, customer feedback, and market trends regularly.

  ### Limitations:
  I had to format the revenue, cost, profit to currency, hide blanks because they will affect the accuarcy of my conclusions from the analytics.
